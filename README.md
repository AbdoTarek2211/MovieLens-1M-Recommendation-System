# MovieLens-1M-Recommendation-System
This project implements a production-ready movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 1M dataset. The system combines multiple recommendation approaches including user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, content-based filtering using TF-IDF vectorization, and advanced matrix factorization techniques (SVD, SVD++, NMF).
